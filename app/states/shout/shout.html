	   Release all your negative feelings of affliction, announce accomplished milestones, get to know other peopleâ€™s point of view on what you think, discover what other people are going through an online chat shout out. This allows everyone to channel their brooding regrets, gloomy states, disappointment about society and personal miseries; get all of this out of their chest.
	   <br>
	   Shout resets every 6am, a sign that it is a new day! A great day to remove hate, a chance to forgive yourself and others, and to be happier everyday.
